# 🚀 Deploy Your 3D Store to Vercel

## Quick Deployment Steps

### Option 1: One-Click Deploy (Recommended)

1. **Push to GitHub:**
```bash
# Initialize git repo (if not already done)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial 3D ecommerce store"

# Create GitHub repo and push
# (Create a new repo on github.com first)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/3d-ecommerce-store.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

2. **Deploy on Vercel:**

   - Vercel will auto-detect it's a React app
   - Click "Deploy" 

3. **Your live 3D store will be at:** `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

### Option 2: Vercel CLI (Alternative)

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from your project directory
cd "/Users/madison.moore/Three D"
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
